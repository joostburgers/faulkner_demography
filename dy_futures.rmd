# Digital Humanities and Literary Studies

Working definition

-   Any form of scholarship, teaching, or publication that uses a computational or digital approach to ask questions in the humanities that would be hard to answer using non-computational methods.

-   An opportunity for the humanities to complicate and question the way in which data is acquired, processed, and represented at a time when ways of knowing the world are increasingly digital.

## DH as Network

There is no "core" DH, but a series of related practices.

![DH as Network](images/DH_network.png){height="700"}

## DH as Network-ish

Practices are markedly different from one another.

## Knowledge Production

Universities have a self-sustaining cycle of knowledge production

"So while digital technology is introducing new critical methods and procedures, it does not fundamentally alter the sociologics of scholarship and education nor their institutional mechanisms."

## Digital Humanist Intervention

-   More open access to scholarship
-   Closer collaborations across and between institutions
-   Literary studies curriculum where teaching and research are indistinguishable from one another, and in which students become scholars from day 0.

# Digital Yoknapatawpha

-   **Teaching:** A means for students to become familiar with Faulkner's world
-   **Research:** A scholarly tool for investigating relationships across the corpus
-   **Publishing:** A publication platform for different scholarly insights based on the data

## Faulkner Mapping

In 1936 and 1945 Faulkner drew two different maps of his famous Yoknapatawpha county.

::: two_image

knitr::include_graphics("http://faulkner.iath.virginia.edu/media/resources/MANUSCRIPTS/AAMapOpen.jpg")

## Mapping Faulkner

The goal of the project was to be as comprehensive as possible.

-   5011 Characters
-   2176 Locations
-   8520 Events

## Racial Distribution

Characters can be grouped together by a common attribute to determine the distribution in the population

```{r dy_characters, cache=TRUE}

    distinct (SourceTextCode, CharacterName, reduced_race) %>% 
              count(reduced_race) %>% 
              mutate(percent = round(n/sum(n),2))
```

```{r plot_dy_characters}

                  plot_ly(
      values =  ~dy_raw_characters$n,
    labels = ~ dy_raw_characters$reduced_race,
    type = 'pie',
    name = "Character Count",
    text = paste(dy_raw_characters$reduced_race, dy_raw_characters$percent*100, "%"),
    textinfo = 'text',
    textposition = "inside",

## Character Representation

The number of times characters occur in events is a proxy for appearances.

## Character Interaction

<p class = "fragment">Characters do not simply appear in the corpus at random they follow a plot.</p>

<p class = "fragment">
"How are [a character’s] appearances positioned in relation to other characters and to the thematic and structural totality of the narrative? Why does a particular character suddenly disappear from the narrative or abruptly begin to gain more narrative attention?" </p>

## Characters as Types

- Determining how characters interact requires knowing more details about them
- Character attributes (Race, Gender) can be strung together to create "types" (i.e. White Male, Black Female, etc.)

## Birds of a feather...

* In statistical ecology, co-occurrence analysis is the process of determining the rules of assembly.
  + If there is a **positive** co-occurrence then one bird appears with another.
  + If there is a **negative** co-occurrence then one bird does not appear when another is present.
  + Co-occurrence can also be **random**, where a bird may appear sometimes and at other times not.

## ...do math!{data-background-transition="none"}

* Probabilistic statistics
   $$
    P_j = \frac{\binom{N_1}{j}\times\binom{N-N_1}{N_2-j}}{\binom{N}{N_2}}

  + All the different combinations of "species 1" at all sites $\binom{N_1}{j}$
  + Multiply the different combinations possible with "species 2" without "species 1"$\binom{N-N_1}{N_2-j}$

## Interactions are Place Specific

Characters do not merely interact, they do so in particular contexts.

There are **31** character types that combine in **528** different ways across **14** different types of locations. Figuring out these relationships becomes very complicated.

## Principal Component Analysis

Principal Component Analysis is a useful technique to reduce the number of dimensions in a data set.

It calculates which components account for the most variance in the data.

## Implications

- Faulkner reproduces the logic of Jim Crow, but does this represent the limits of his imagination or the beginning of the plot?

- What is the function of "background" characters? Do they "exist" or are they really just part of the setting?

- What does it mean for the reader when the social world is represented continously in one way throughout a work of fiction?

## Great!

- But now what?
- Where does this go?
