<h1>Character Interaction</h1>
<p class="fragment">
Characters do not simply appear in the corpus at random they follow a
plot.
</p>
<p class="fragment">
“How are [a character’s] appearances positioned in relation to other
characters and to the thematic and structural totality of the narrative?
Why does a particular character suddenly disappear from the narrative or
abruptly begin to gain more narrative attention?”

<h1>Interactions are Place Specific</h1>
<p>Characters do not merely interact, they do so in particular
contexts.</p>
<p>There are <strong>31</strong> character types that combine in
<strong>528</strong> different ways across <strong>14</strong> different
types of locations. Figuring out these relationships becomes very
complicated.</p>
